Think of it this way, I have a vault server. I have a laptop. Both are different machines not connected except by the internet. I need to use a `curl` command to query the vault server. I then need to take the result of that query which is a JSON object and I need to extract the value at `data.value`. That make more sense? I repeat though, this is being done on a different machine than the vault server!" CreationDate="2018-07-12T19:09:46.253" UserDisplayName="user8517" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

There are two major reasons, first, the systems you listed retain information ephemerally i.e. all information is lost following a shutdown. Secondly, asides the application metadata e.g. endpoints, it is important to have knowledge about deployment dates, test dates i.e. the information about the application's lifecycle.

Playbooks are strategies, they invoke roles which execute relevant tasks based on what you're throwing them at. Abstract roles should be able to pick up different vars, depending on their targets, and still do the right thing. The devices should deliver  relevant facts about themselves to the roles. Using roles over playbooks gives you the explicit advantage of also being able to thoroughly test the roles.

Most DBA's are very keen on fully modelling data inside the database (creating as full a model using relationships etc). This essentially maintains the monolithic nature of your system both from a &quot;pet&quot; vs &quot;cattle&quot; production point of view and from a change flexibility point of view. If you design a data structure where relationships are either absent or very carefully contained, the data ceases to need the &quot;pet&quot; treatment and containerisation is possible top to bottom."
